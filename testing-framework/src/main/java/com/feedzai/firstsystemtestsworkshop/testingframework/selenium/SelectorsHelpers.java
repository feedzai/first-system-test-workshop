 * Class that contains the different Selectors used in the Selenium code to identify the page elements.
 * @implNote In this workshop we are using different strategies with the purpose of showing that they exist.
 * In a real project, we should work along side with the development team in a common strategy on how the
 * pages should be created and which elements could be used in the test automation.
 * E.g. we at Feedzai use a specific css class to identify elements that could be used in the automated tests.
